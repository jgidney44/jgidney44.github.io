<span class="research-title">Normal coverings of the remaining classical groups.</span>
<br>
PhD Thesis
<br>
Ongoing
</div>

Given a finite group, it can be shown by a simple counting argument that it cannot be written as the union of the conjugates of a single proper subgroup. This naturally leads to the question: what is the smallest number of subgroups such that all their conjugates
cover the group? We call this value the normal covering number. 
<br>
Building on the work of Britnell and Mar&oacute;ti on the general linear group, I am currently investigating bounds on the normal covering number of the symplectic, orthogonal and unitary groups.

Master's Thesis

</div>

Choose two elements at random from a finite group, what is the probability that they commute? This probability, called the degree of commutativity, measures the abelianess of a group. It turns out, if a group is non-abelian this probability is at most 5/8
and this value is achieved by the dihedral and quaternion group of order eight. 
<br>
In this report I explore how the degree of commutativity is linked to properties such as solubility and nilpotence. I then look to isoclinisms, a relation between groups under
which the degree of commutativity is preserved. From this I prove that there are a finite amount of values the degree of commutativity can achieve strictly between 11/32 and 1/2. Furthermore I show there is a countable family of values the degree of
commutativity can achieve above 1/2. For some of these values, I show that they uniquely determine the isoclinism class of that group. 
<br>
Finally, I present an analogue of the degree of commutativity for infinite groups originally
introduced by Antol&iacute;n, Martino and Ventura, and prove some analogous results to the finite case.

High quality datasets such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) can be used to model child poverty and inform organisations and policymakers where the need is most. However these surveys are expensive and time consuming to collect, and 
can quickly become outdated, making any models less effective into the future. Improvements to computer-vision models alongside easy access to Landsat and Sentinel satellite data offer a way of extending these models and potentially improving 
temporal and spatial estimates of child poverty.
<br>
In this paper we assess the effectiveness of computer-vision models including DINOv2, and satellite specific models such as MOSAIKS and SatMAE in predicting the
level of child poverty across nineteen countries in Africa.
