Choose two elements at random from a finite group, what is the probability that they commute? This probability, called the degree of commutativity, measures the abelianess of a group. It turns out, if a group is non-abelian this probability is at most 5/8
and this value is achieved by the dihedral and quaternion group of order eight. In this report I explore how the degree of commutativity is linked to properties such as solubility and nilpotence. I then look to isoclinisms, a relation between groups under
which the degree of commutativity is preserved. From this I prove that there are a finite amount of values the degree of commutativity can achieve strictly between 11/32 and 1/2. Furthermore I show there is a countable family of values the degree of
commutativity can achieve above 1/2. For some of these values, I show that they uniquely determine the isoclinism class of that group. Finally, I present an analogue of the degree of commutativity for infinite groups originally
introduced by Antolin, Martino and Ventura, and prove some analogous results to the finite case.
